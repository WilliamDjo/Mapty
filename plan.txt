Project Planning
1) User Stories
    A high level overview of the whole application which will allow developers to determine the exact features that they 
    need to implement in order to make the user stories actually work as intended.
2) Determine Features 
3) Make Flowchart
4) Project Architecture 
    How will you organize your code and what javascript features you will use.
    What holds all the code together.
    It gives a structure in which we can then develop the application's functionality
5) Development
    Implement your plan using javascript code.

Flowchart
- A Flowchart tells us what a program should do but how it does.
- Whenever you start to build a Flowchart, it's a good idea to start with events.
- Page loading is always at the start.
- To differentiate:
    - Yellow: Actions/Events
    - Green: Things you will render on the UI
    - Red: Operations that happen asynchronously
- It's perfectly ok to create a rough sketch in the beginning and then come up with the exact detail during the implementation
- Don't get hang up on building the perfect flowchart.
